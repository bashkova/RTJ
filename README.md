# Research Repository: "Stochastic Modeling of Differential Equations of Robot Swarm Motion"

This repository contains code and data for the stochastic modeling of robot swarm dynamics.

## Experiment Data:
The experimental data is stored in .pickle files. Each file contains a nested list representing the time-series (frame-by-frame) state of the robot swarm. Each inner list contains the state of all robots for a single frame.
Robot State: For each robot, the primary data includes its displacement coordinates (x, y) and its orientation angle (Î¸).
